# StateSync utility

This utility implements a [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) approach for managing OS packages and settings.

Of course, I know about [Ansible]([https://](https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative)) and [Ubuntu autoinstall](https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/intro-to-autoinstall.html), but right now, the main goal of this repository is to learn the technologies more deeply.

## How it works

First you need to create a YAML [configuration file](https://github.com/artur-titov/state-sync/blob/master/config-example.yml).

Following the GitOps approach, place the config file in a separate repository.

Distribution via a Deb package and sync based on a remote file are not implemented yet. However, you can clone both repositories to the target host.

After that run sync command:

```sh
make sync FROM="<path_to_config_file>"
```

The OS synchronizes with the settings entered in the configuration file.
