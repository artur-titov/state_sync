#
# Basic concept:
#
# stack - all settings pools;
# pool - several sections (applications, late_commands - permanent mandatory names);
# section - several units (free to naming);
# unit - entity with items (app, group);
# item - least entity (package, command);
#
global:
  #
  # If you don`t want to sync some pool, just hide them.
  # App removal implemented at the unit settings level (presented: yes/no).
  pool_to_synchronize:
    - applications
    # - late_commands

applications:
  #
  # You can split the application settings into different sections.
  # For example: "test" or "os_features", "user_stack", etc.
  test:
    #
    # This is application example
    # that containing one package.
    # 
    # Use "app" for application title.
    # This title will be shows in the terminal output when sync process starts.
    - app: Hello World
      #
      # When your application is not installed and "presented" sets to "no"
      # there will be no changes.
      #
      # When your application is installed and "presented" sets to "no"
      # your application will be removed.
      #
      # When your application is installed and "presented" sets to "yes"
      # there will be no changes either.
      presented: yes
      #
      # Here you can set distributor for your application.
      # (apt, snap, flatpak only supported yet)
      distributor: snap
      #
      # If your snap application setup needs a --classic argument, set
      # "classic: yes". If you don`t need --classic argument
      # you don`t need set this parameter. Just don't write it.
      classic: yes
      # You can add more than one package for one application.
      packages:
        - hello-world

late_commands:
  ui_settings:
    - group: test_app
      commands:
        - command_1
        - command_2
      execute: yes
